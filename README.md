I demonstrated strong ownership and a growth mindset by proactively expanding my technical skill set and taking on backend development responsibilities for the first time during this period. I invested time in understanding backend systems, workflows, and dependencies, and successfully delivered production-ready features such as email notifications, database configuration updates, and time-sensitive logic fixes. This transition required learning new technologies and debugging approaches, which I embraced with initiative and persistence. My willingness to step outside my comfort zone and contribute across the full stack reflects my motivation to continuously learn, add value to the team, and grow as an engineer.
