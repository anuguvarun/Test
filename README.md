Impact

Over this period, I delivered multiple high-impact enhancements and fixes across the donor flex and trading workflows. I supported PS2 and successfully resolved a critical issue, improved step-2 alignment to enhance usability, and implemented a design update across the entire donor flex application. I fixed a major bug that allowed non-DAIP accounts to incorrectly access the DF flow even after closing and reopening tabs, ensuring compliance and correct user access. Additionally, I implemented the held securities feature, enabling donors to clearly see existing brokerage holdings, which significantly improved transparency and user confidence. Backend improvements such as email notifications upon trade submission and daylight-saving-time–aware market hours handling increased system reliability and operational accuracy. I also updated database configurations with new CG reference codes to support accurate trade status tracking and successfully supported three production releases in October.

Self Motivation

I consistently demonstrated strong ownership and accountability by proactively identifying issues, driving fixes to completion, and ensuring high-quality delivery without constant supervision. I took initiative to understand complex edge cases—such as session persistence and time-based logic—and addressed them thoroughly to prevent recurring issues. My motivation to improve both user experience and backend stability drove me to go beyond basic fixes and deliver durable, scalable solutions.

Teamwork & Collaboration

I worked closely with cross-functional partners, including design, backend, and QA teams, to ensure changes were aligned with business requirements and thoroughly tested before release. I collaborated effectively during release cycles, responding quickly to issues and supporting multiple deployments. My communication with teammates helped surface risks early and ensured smooth handoffs across teams.

Leadership & Influence

I demonstrated leadership by taking responsibility for critical areas of the donor flex and trading flow, especially in high-impact bug fixes and release support. By maintaining high engineering standards and attention to detail, I helped set expectations for quality and reliability within the team. I also influenced outcomes by advocating for fixes that improved long-term maintainability, such as proper handling of daylight saving time and standardized CG reference codes.

Forward Looking

Going forward, I aim to further strengthen system resilience by proactively identifying edge cases earlier in the development cycle and improving automated test coverage around complex workflows such as session handling, time-based logic, and account eligibility. I also plan to deepen my involvement in architectural discussions and mentor teammates where possible, contributing not only through execution but also through technical guidance and continuous improvement of our development practices.
