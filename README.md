Impact Statement:

This quarter, I contributed to improving the user experience and system robustness by delivering multiple enhancements across the application flow. I implemented routing guards between Step 1 and Step 2 to prevent unintended navigation, presenting users with a confirmation modal. I also enhanced Step 1 by introducing validation for the “Sell” flow, ensuring users cannot sell more than their available quantity or amount. Additionally, I contributed to building and refining the Thank You page logic by grouping trade cards under “Buy” and “Sell” categories, which dynamically reflect data from Step 1. I also added missing fields for liquidate and fees in Step 2, ensuring completeness of transaction data.

Self-Motivation:

I proactively took ownership of both new development and existing gaps within the user journey. My contributions ranged from implementing core validations to fixing critical navigation issues—such as resolving a bug in GC where the Back button was non-functional in Step 2. I maintained a strong focus on usability and correctness while working independently and across modules. My drive to improve the user flow and eliminate edge cases reflects my commitment to delivering a seamless and reliable experience.

Teamwork & Collaboration:

I worked closely with team members throughout the quarter, actively supporting their development efforts and helping unblock issues when needed. I played a key role during the “Support May Release,” ensuring a stable rollout by providing timely fixes and verifications. I also contributed to peer code reviews, offered constructive feedback, and participated in sprint discussions to align user stories with development goals. This collaborative mindset helped strengthen team productivity and cohesion.
